CtrlP extension for fuzzy-searching in tag matches. May be used instead of :tjump or :tselect for IDE-like Goto declaration functionality, which jumps to the declaration in case of one match, and shows quick-search window in case of multiple matches.

https://github.com/ivalkeen/vim-ctrlp-tjump

Prerequisites:
1. CtrlP should be installed
2. Tags should already work with :tag, :tselect and :tjump commands.

Installation:
1. Use your favorite method (I prefer Vundle)
2. (Optional) Create mapping
nnoremap <c-]> :CtrlPtjump<cr>
Note for Ruby users: to support identifiers with ! and ? in the end, consider adding one more mapping to your .vimrc
autocmd FileType ruby,eruby nnoremap <silent> <buffer> <C-]> :call ctrlp#tjump#exec(RubyCursorIdentifier())<CR>
This requires vim-ruby plugin to be installed

Usage:
1. Move cursor to the Class/Method usage in your code
2. Press c-] (if you have created mapping) or just execute :CtrlPtjump in the command line.
